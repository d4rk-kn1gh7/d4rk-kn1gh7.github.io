I'm Anand Balaji, a student doing his B.Tech in Computer Science (Specializing in Artificial Intelligence) at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri Campus.

I'm interested in cyber security, and am an active CTF player with <a href="https://www.bi0s.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team bi0s</a>. I do binary exploitation and exploit development, and you can probably catch me playing CTFs every weekend.

I'm also an avid gamer in my free time.
