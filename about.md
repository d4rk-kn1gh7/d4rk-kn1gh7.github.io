I'm Anand Balaji, a student doing his B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri Campus.

I love exploit development, and play CTFs every week with <a href="https://www.bi0s.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team bi0s</a>

I've loved computers since I was a kid, and I'm an avid gamer in my free time.
